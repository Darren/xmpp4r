== Connecting to Google Talk

Google Talk doesn't seem to allow XMPP-compliant connections on the 5222 port,
according to http://www.google.com/talk/otherclients.html and the various
tutorials liked from there.

The solution is to use an SSL connection:
cl = Client::new(myJID)
cl.use_ssl = true
cl.connect
cl.auth(myPassword)
cl.send(Presence::new)
